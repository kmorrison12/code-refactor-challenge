# Code Refactor Challenge ReadMe

## User story

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that our own site is optimized for search engines.


## Acceptance criteria

Given a webpage meets accessibility standards

* When I view the source code, I find semantic HTML elements

* When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

* When I view the image elements, I find accessible alt attributes

* When I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order

* When I view the title element, I find a concise, descriptive title
